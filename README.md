# 📊 PRODIGY_ML_02 - K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

This project was completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

Implement a **K-means clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their **purchase history**.  
The main goal is to identify meaningful customer segments for better business strategies.

---

## 📂 Dataset

Used the **Customer Segmentation** dataset from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Loaded the dataset and explored key statistics.
2. **Feature Selection** – Chose `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)` for clustering.
3. **Data Scaling** – Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
4. **Elbow Method** – Used WCSS to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. **K-means Clustering** – Applied clustering with 5 clusters.
6. **Visualization** – Plotted the clusters using a scatter plot.

## ✅ Result

Successfully segmented customers into 5 distinct clusters based on their spending habits and income.  
This task enhanced my understanding of **unsupervised learning** and **customer behavior analysis** using K-means.
